      <Paragraph>
        This quote is what we say when people ask us why we built P&P. But it&rsquo;s not the whole story. Our intention
        with this quote is not to say that we&rsquo;re the first people to build a planning poker app. We&rsquo;re not.
        Also, we don&rsquo;t want to say that we&rsquo;re the only people who can build a planning poker app.
        We&rsquo;re not.&nbsp;
        <b>
          And most importantly, we don&rsquo;t want to say that there aren&rsquo;t any other planning poker apps out
          there that are better than ours
        </b>
        . There might be.

      <Paragraph>
        What we want to say is that we&rsquo;re not aware of any other planning poker app that has the features that we
        want. And that&rsquo;s why we built P&P. We built it for ourselves, and we&rsquo;re sharing it with you.

      <Paragraph>
        As the name suggests, P&P may sound like &ldquo;plug&rdquo; and &ldquo;play&rdquo;, and that is the idea behind
        it. We want to make it easy for you to start using P&P, and we want to make it easy for you to integrate P&P
        into your existing workflow.
