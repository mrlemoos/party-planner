      <Paragraph>
        This quote is what we say when people ask us why we built Planria. But it&rsquo;s not the whole story. Our
        intention with this quote is not to say that we&rsquo;re the first people to build a planning poker app.
        We&rsquo;re not. Also, we don&rsquo;t want to say that we&rsquo;re the only people who can build a planning
        poker app. We&rsquo;re not.&nbsp;
        <b>
          And most importantly, we don&rsquo;t want to say that there aren&rsquo;t any other planning poker apps out
          there that are better than ours
        </b>
        . There might be.

      <Paragraph>
        What we want to say is that we&rsquo;re not aware of any other planning poker app that has the features that we
        want. And that&rsquo;s why we built Planria. We built it for ourselves, and we&rsquo;re sharing it with you.

        Planria has the idea idea behind of being a <b>plug-and-play</b> experience. We want to make it easy for you to
        start using Planria, and we want to make it easy for you to integrate Planria into your existing workflow.
