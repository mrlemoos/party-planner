# Party Planner 🎉

The product built on top of NextJS that makes Story Pointing the User Stories for your next sprint nice and fun! 🎉

## Getting Started ⛳️

As we're using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as our package manager, you'll need to install it first. Then, you can run the following commands:

```bash
yarn install # or just "yarn" if you don't like to type too much
```

After that, you can run the following command to start the development server:

```bash
yarn run dev # or "yarn dev"
```

To generate the **Production** environment build, you can run the following command:

```bash
yarn run build
```

And to run the **Production** environment build, you can run the following command (Note that you need to have generated the production build first):

```bash
yarn run start
```
